# MIA’S Training “phase 1 tasks”

This repository contains various tasks and projects developed as part of my training with MIA Robotics . The tasks are focused on building and enhancing skills in embedded systems, programming, hardware design, circuit implementation, electronics, communication protocols, and simulation tools. The repository is organized to reflect the diverse learning experiences in both hardware and software aspects of robotics.

Tasks Overview:

**task 1 : heroic problem solving**

**using C++ Programming Language**

- Participated in a HackerRank contest to solve a series of problems using C++.
- Focused on applying object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts and improving algorithmic thinking.
- Enhancing code efficiency and readability through in C++.

**task 2 : heroic Hardware Challenges**

**Hardware Design and Circuit Implementation using proteus**

- Using Proteus for circuit simulation and testing, ensuring designs work as expected before physical implementation.
- Integrating different electronic components, including resistors, capacitors, transistors, and ICs.
- **Battery Session:** focused on understanding battery types, selection criteria, and power management for any system .

**task 3 : Gotham’s minefield**
**circuits simulation using Tinkercad**

- Designing and building custom circuits for various robotic applications.
- Using Tinkercad for circuit simulation and testing, ensuring designs work as expected before physical implementation.
- Working with breadboards, Arduino UNO , and soldering techniques.
- Integrating different electronic components, including resistors, Light emmitting diodes (LEDs) , capacitors, transistors, and ICs.
- assembling the mini-tasks into a cohesive, functional system -**Minesweeper Tank**- capable of performing the required tasks autonomously.

**task 4 : Overcoming The Tempest**
**data analysis** **using python programming Language** 

**creating a Machine Learning Model**

- Conducted weather data analysis using Python, exploring trends and patterns.
- Developed a Machine Learning Model to predict weather conditions, leveraging libraries like scikit-learn.
- Used Google Colab and Jupyter Notebook for data analysis, model training, and evaluation.
- Visualized the results to interpret model accuracy and reliability.
- Developed a chess game with a graphical user interface (GUI) using Python.
- Designed the game interface and integrated game logic to handle player moves, including special moves like castling and en passant.

**task 5 : Communicate**
**using TinkerCad for communication protocols and jupyter notebook as a graphing tool**

- Designing and implementing a system to convert analog signals into digital form for effective signal processing and analysis.
- developing a communication system where a master Arduino managed communication between two slave Arduinos : one connected via I2C and the other via serial communication. The master Arduino relayed messages between the slaves, who were not directly connected, ensuring effective communication within the system.

**task 6 : heroic PCB**

**using altium designer**

- Creating a PCB design for an H-bridge motor driver circuit to control the direction and speed of DC motors.
- Creating a schematic diagram of the H-bridge circuit using Altium Designer Included key components such as MOSFETs , resistors, and diodes.
- Routed traces to connect components, ensuring proper signal integrity and power distribution and applied design rules to manage trace width, spacing, and clearance.

**task 7 : Smart Heroic Tools** 

**using GIT / GITHub and dealing with LINUX OS**

- Created a new GitHub repository to organize and manage previous tasks effectively.
- Created separate branches for each task, naming each branch according to the specific task it represents.
- Creating a README file by Notion and Adding it to the main branch where I Wrote a detailed description of the repository, including an overview of each task and its purpose.
- Practiced basic Linux commands including `ls`, `cd`, `pwd`, `mkdir`, `rm`, `cp`, `mv`, `cat`, `nano`, and others.
- Performed various operations to understand the functionality and usage of each command.

  **task 8 : clash of shadows**

  **using c++ programming language**

- showcasing how OOP concepts can be applied to simulate a fight game in C++.
- understanding basic game mechanics and OOP in C++.
- creating a state diagram for the game .
